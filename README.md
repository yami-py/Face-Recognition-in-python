# Face-Recognition-in-python
Face Recognition System in Python
This Python program implements a face recognition system.

Features:
Detects faces in images or from a webcam stream.
Recognizes faces based on a training dataset.
(Optional: Include features like name labeling, distance threshold for recognition)
Dependencies
This program requires the following Python libraries:

OpenCV (https://opencv.org/)
(Optional: Mention any other libraries used, e.g., NumPy for image manipulation)
Installation:

Download and install Python 3.x from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Install the required libraries using pip:
pip install opencv-python  # (and other libraries)
Usage
Training:
Prepare a dataset of images containing faces of known individuals. Ensure each image has a single face.
Run the training script (e.g., train.py) to generate facial encodings and save them for later recognition.
(Optional: Specify how the training script is run and arguments it accepts)
Recognition:
Run the recognition script (e.g., recognize.py).
The script will prompt for an image or access the webcam.
Faces will be detected and compared against the training data.
Recognized faces will be displayed with labels (if implemented).
Note:

The training dataset significantly impacts the accuracy of the recognition.
Ensure proper lighting and image quality for better results.
Running the program
Save the Python files (e.g., train.py, recognize.py) in a directory.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory.
Training:

python train.py  # (Optional: Add arguments if your script requires them)
Recognition:

python recognize.py

Face recognition technology can be sensitive and may have limitations. Use this program responsibly and ethically.
